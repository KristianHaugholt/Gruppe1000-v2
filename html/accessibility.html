            What did we change after testing?
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performace enhancmenet</strong>: Some pages had suboptimal performance after initial testing. To improve this we optimized the css and removed unimportant code. Furthermore we also compressed some of the lager images and implemented lazy loading on all pictures. Note the perfomance on the Index page is not perfect, due to us wanting to keep full functianliti and not compromize the restructuring of the page, even though it would enhance performance. </li>
            <li><strong>SEO and best Practices</strong>: To optimize SEO and best Practices we added meta descriptions in the "head" to explain what the page is about</li>
            <li><strong>Accessebility</strong>: To improve accessebility we added viewport as meta text, to accomedate all screen widts, as well as resizing images depending on the screen size </li>

        </ul>

        <h1>How did we implement Universal design?</h1>
        <p>
            Making a website accessible for all users is equally as important as having it perform well.
            After all, what good is a superfast website if it cant be used by everybody.
            We have therefore taken several measures to make sure our website can be utilized by every person.
        </p>
        <h2>Dropdown menus</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly, we have built in graphic indicators where possible to make the navigation as smooth and intuitive as possible.
            All dropdown menus are indicated by either a “+” or by the classic “hamburger button”.
            To close the menu the indicator turns into either a ”-“ or a “X”.
            Avoiding a text-based description for important functions not only smoothens the user experience but also makes the page accessible for user of all languages and age groups.
        </p>
        <h2>Flexibility and low effort </h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned, do all function buttons act as menu’ openers and closers.
            This means that the user does not have to move the mouse to close a given menu, limiting the physical effort to interact with the functions.
            Furthermore, the inclusion of both a header and footer with links to all other pages minimize travel.
            Since it now does not mater if the user is at the top or bottom of a given page, the option to switch to another page will always be close by.
            While the footer has direct links to the other pages, we chose to hide the links in the header behind a menu.
            Because we did not want to clutter up the top of the page with lots of links to keep some kind of aesthetic, so we made the compromise with a menu in the header.
        </p>
        <h2>Sizing</h2>
        <p>
            We were also aware of that a wide range of devices are going to access our website. That’s why we adjust the structure of site according to the screen size of the user to ensures that all users have the same experience. This for example prevents mobile users with a small screen from having lots of wasted space because the margin and padding are not adjusted.
        </p>
        <h2>Spacing and Approach </h2>
        <p>
            We have tried to give each section of the page its own dedicated space to clear up the site.  All points of interests are spaced away from each other in a way that preferably does not increase the travel distance unnecessarily. In both the header and footer all information is placed in between a generous amount of space. On one side this can led to the user having to search through more of the screen to find the desired information. On the other hand spacing the elements/information like we did lets the user get a quick overview and  easy understanding of what information belongs together. We believe that this will lead to a better user experience in the long term.
        </p>
