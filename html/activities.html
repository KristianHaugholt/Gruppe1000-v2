                Originally called Puck Man[a] in Japan, is a 1980 maze video game developed and released by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco">Namco</a> for arcades. In North America, the game was
                released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player
                controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored
                ghosts.
                Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue,
                allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.</p>

                For 200 years, the Norwegian Students' Society (Det Norske Studentersamfund) has been a gathering
                place for Oslo's many students. For over 50 of those years, the Students' Society has been based
                at the top of Majorstuen, at <a href="https://neuf.no/">Chateu Neuf.</a>
                Chateau Neuf was designed by the award-winning architects Lund and Slaatto. It is considered a prime
                example of modern Norwegian post-war architecture and was therefore listed as a state-protected cultural
                heritage property in 2014. The listing includes the entire exterior as well as the entrance area and foyer.

                Trousers (British English), slacks, or pants (<a href="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/16/18/newFile-3.jpg">American</a>, Canadian and Australian English) are an item of
                clothing worn from the waist to anywhere between the knees and the ankles, covering both legs separately
                (rather than with cloth extending across both legs as in robes, skirts, dresses and kilts). In some parts
                of the United Kingdom, the word pants is ambiguous: it can mean underpants rather than trousers.[1] Shorts
                are similar to trousers, but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower
                depending on the style of the garment.</p>

                The gameplay experience varies radically between video games, but many common elements exist.
                Most games will launch into a title screen and give the player a chance to review options such as the
                number of players before starting a game. Most games are divided into levels which the player must work
                the avatar through, scoring points, collecting power-ups to boost the avatar's innate attributes, all while
                either using special attacks to defeat enemies or moves to avoid them.
